Syntax
-------

To inject a variable into the page, define the variable in the components ts file and use the variable in the components html file.
To use a variable in the html file, use {{var_name}}
To create a constructor, just use the method constructor()
While defining a new model,
- Create an html component
- Create a style component
- Create a model ts file
  = export interface interface_name{} => This contains definition of the model.
  = Import the interface into the controller file.
  = import {} from file_name
- The controller goes in the component.ts file.
Most of the angular methods have ng as prefix
-ngOnInit()
inside the tag, (click) -> onClick()
-(click)="fn()"
(keyup.enter) -> When content is wrote and enter key is pressed.
You need to import all the modules that you are going to use in the module.ts file.
-For forms, import {module_name} from "angular/forms";
-Also, fill the declarations with declarations that you have used and imports with modules you have imported.
-Import animation while deleting
-First project
-SASS
-Typescript
Looping - *ngFor="let var of sequence"
-*ngFor="let item of list"
Enter value to the model:
-[(ngModel)]="todoValue"
